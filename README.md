YOPyRa-NG: Support for simple animations with changing object positions - Computer Graphics - UCLM

## Author and Acknowledgment
The YOPyRa-NG code for this project was created by Carlos Gonz√°lez Morcillo (Carlos.Gonzalez@uclm.es) for the Computer Graphics course at the University of Castilla-La Mancha.

I'm extending the functionality of YOPyRa-NG to be able to generate simple animations.

For more information about the YOPyRa-NG code, consult the [readme](./YOPyRaNG/README.md) inside its folder.
